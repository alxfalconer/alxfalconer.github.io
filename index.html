<p>While React is extremely intuitive and user-friendly for fledgling developers learning the ropes, it has limitations when it comes to project size and server-side development. As I continue studying suggested skills for a Frontend Developer — languages, frameworks, etc. — one unfamiliar name keeps popping up: Angular. Having worked exclusively with React during my time at Flatiron, I decided to do a deep dive into Angular to best prep myself for any development scenario — technical advantages, benefits, use cases, etc.  

<p>Whereas React is based on the Virtual DOM and basic JavaScript library, Angular is centered around the Model View Controller and TypeScript. TypeScript is a superset of JS, allowing for increased efficiency on larger collaborative projects by making code more consistent, clean and reusable. While Vanilla JS is mainly used client-side for design and interaction purposes, TypeScript can be used both client and server-side.

<p>While react is extremely intuitive and user-friendly for fledgling developers learning the ropes, it has limitations when it comes to project size and server-side development. It may have a steeper learning curve than React but is an an ideal framework when you want ready-to-use solutions, cleaner code development and higher performance. I look forward to gaining more hands-on experience as I continue my deep dive.
